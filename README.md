# C# Basics - 10 Simple Exercises

## Introduction

This project is designed to help you revisit the **fundamentals** of C# through a series of **10 simple exercises**. The goal is to get back to basics, manipulate simple data types like integers and strings, and strengthen your problem-solving skills in a clean, no-frills way.

After spending a week working with complex frontend technologies, this project will focus on **back to basics** C# challenges that will help you refresh your skills in a fun and relaxed manner.

## Objectives

- Practice working with **integers (int)** and **strings** in C#.
- Solve basic programming problems to reinforce key concepts.
- Improve problem-solving skills by building a solid foundation in **C# fundamentals**.
- Complete 10 exercises that focus on manipulating numbers and strings.

## How to Use This Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csharp-basics-exercises.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd csharp-basics-exercises
    ```

3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.).

4. Go through each exercise one by one:
   - Solve the problem by writing C# code.
   - Test your solution by running the program.

5. Each exercise should be self-contained, and you can modify the `Program.cs` file to add or update your code.
